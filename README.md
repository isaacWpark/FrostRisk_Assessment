# FrostRisk_Assessment
Code and Supplementary Files for Assessment of pre-1980 and post-1979 risk of frost exposure to floral tissues across North American angiosperms

Scripts: 
FrostRisk_Pre1980_post1979.ipynb includes all analyses used to evaluate differences in frost risk between specimens collected pre-1980 and those collected post-1979.

Frost_assessment_MovingWindow.ipynb includes all analyses used to evaluate differences in frost risk from using 20-year moving window averages calculated annually from 1920-2015.  

These scripts were used to evaluate of 475,694 herbarium-based observations of 1,653 angiosperm species that were collected in flower between 1920 and 2015.  While these data cannot be shared here due to restrictions on data sharing put in place by the source herbaria, a dataset documenting all data fields used to identify the contributing specimens were included here in a separate field (included with data acquisition instructions in the file SpecimenID_Data.zip).
